# Deep Learning with PyTorch: CNN Implementation and Evaluation

In this task, you will be implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. You can choose to work with either the CIFAR-10 or Fashion-MNIST dataset. The task consists of the following steps:

## 1. Dataset Selection

- Select either the CIFAR-10 or Fashion-MNIST dataset for your implementation.
- Provide a brief overview of the dataset, including the number of classes, the number of samples per class, and the dimensionality of the input data.
- Discuss why you chose this particular dataset and its relevance to the problem you aim to solve.

## 2. CNN Implementation

- Implement a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch for your chosen dataset.
- Design the architecture of the CNN, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and activation functions.
- Consider using techniques such as batch normalization or dropout to improve the performance and generalization of the network.
- Train the CNN using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) and loss function (e.g., cross-entropy).
- Utilize techniques such as data augmentation (e.g., random crops, flips) to enhance the model's ability to generalize.

## 3. Evaluation and Results

- Evaluate the performance of your CNN on the chosen dataset.
- Report metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's classification performance.
- Discuss the results, including any challenges encountered during training or unexpected behaviors observed.
- Analyze the impact of different hyperparameters or network architectures on the model's performance.
- Compare your results with the state-of-the-art performance on the dataset, if available.

## 4. Case Study on Regression/Classification Problem

- Select a regression or classification problem for a case study. The dataset and topic of the study should be approved by your instructors.
- Present the dataset and provide a comprehensive overview, including the number of features, the target variable, and any preprocessing steps required.
- Describe and implement a suitable deep learning model (e.g., CNN, MLP) for the chosen problem.
- Train and evaluate the model on the dataset, using appropriate evaluation metrics for regression or classification tasks.
- Present and discuss the results, including the model's performance, any limitations or challenges encountered, and potential areas for improvement.
- Analyze the insights gained from the study and discuss the practical implications of the model's predictions or regression analysis.

## Conclusion

This task involves implementing a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch for either the CIFAR-10 or Fashion-MNIST dataset. By evaluating the CNN on the chosen dataset and conducting a case study on a regression or classification problem, you will gain practical experience in deep learning model development, evaluation, and analysis. It is important to interpret and discuss the results in a meaningful way, highlighting the strengths and limitations of your approach and proposing potential avenues for future improvement.
